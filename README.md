# dotfiles
~~Simple~~ backup and deploy system settings

Now with `/etc` scripts support!

# WTF IS THIS

Inside of you there are two ~~wolves~~ branches `macos` and `linux`.

One is too lazy to use a single script because paths are different in some config files and the other one can't be bothered to manually type it each time depending on which system so it's easier just to checkout the required branch.

## Troubleshooting

You were using github but moved to gitlab? 

```
cd existing_repo
git remote rename origin old-origin
git remote add origin git@<newrepo>
```
