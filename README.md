# Introduction

Home of my dotfiles, second iteration, using GNU Stow.

# Pre-requisites

## Darwin
```zsh
xcode-select --install
```

## Other
Not yet tested :(

# This is what you came for

1. Clone repo 

```zsh
git clone git@salsa.debian.org:uriel/dotfiles.git .dotfiles
cd .dotfiles
```

2. Execute `da_wae`. This script will stash unsaved stuff, pull from `main` pop the stash and then the magic of `stow`.

```zsh
cd .bin
./da_wae
```

3. Install Homebrew, followed by the software listed in the Brewfile.

# Install Oh my zsh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"

# Install Homebrew
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Install brewfile
cd bundles && brew bundle
```

# Useful extras

## Archived utilities

- `/bin/stock-sux/Posy's Cursor.zip ` [Posy's improved cursors for Windows 10 (and older)](http://www.michieldb.nl/other/cursors/)
- `/bin/stock-sux/Atkinson Hyperlegible.zip` [Braille Institute's high readability open source font](https://brailleinstitute.org/freefont)

## Set-upstream sux

From git 2.37.0 you can forget about the `--set-upstream <branch_name>` with a simple one time command
```
git config --global --add --bool push.autoSetupRemote true
```
Now, we donâ€™t need to set upstream for every new branch manually. 

## How to update brewfile
If you already have one brewfile in the same path there's a paddlin'

```zsh
# Go to the dotfiles folder
cd ~/.dotfiles 
brew bundle dump
```

## Additional MacOS tips 

```
# Fuck autoboot, all my homies have to push the button to boot
sudo nvram AutoBoot=%00 # Disable, %03 is default for enabled

# Silent boot? Hell yeah
sudo nvram BootAudio=%00 # Disable, enabled is %01
```
